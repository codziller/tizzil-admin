# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Bani Merchant Dashboard Project Outline

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

- **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Features/Fixes

<!-- Done updates -->

<!-- New updates -->

1. Update src\services\donations.js so that the queries and mutations provided below are implemented in it and then integrate them in the WalletStore src\pages\Dashboard\Wallet\store\index.js. See src\pages\Dashboard\Users\store\index.js for how the apis from services are integrated in the store. .
   Update src\pages\Dashboard\Wallet\features\index.js so that on mount of the page, getBrandWithdrawalHistory, getWithdrawalSummary, getBrandCommissionSettings, getBrandCommissionHistory, getBrandPayoutHistory, and getBrandBankAccounts are called from WalletStore. if brandBankAccounts is empty, show a notifier(use the style used for Order Notification in src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\ProductDetailsModal.js) below the Wallet Cards Grid container, and the text should convey that they have not created a bank account and they should do so in order to process payment(use a more concise and clear message), on click of the notifier, open AddBankAccountModal(not yet created, so create it). Use src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\AddProductModal.js as guide on how to arrange AddBankAccountModal, categorize the fields in CreateBrandBankAccountInput into three tabs just the way it is done in AddProductModal(use your discretion) and then show the Tabs Details based on the active tab just like is done in AddProductModal. Use src\components\General\Checkbox.js for Boolean fields. On submit, call createBrandBankAccount from WalletStore to create the account number. In src\pages\Dashboard\Wallet\features\index.js, if there are brandBankAccounts, or withdrawalSummary?.minimumWithdrawal, add a section like 'Pie Chart and Additional Cards Section' in src\components\Dashboard\AdminDashboard\AdminDashboard.js and put TopItemsCard(src\components\General\TopItemsCard\index.js) for 'Bank Account'(brandBankAccounts) first, followed by a RateCard(src\components\Dashboard\RateCard\RateCard.js) for 'minimum withdrawal'.

   Update src\components\General\RequestPayoutModal\index.js so that it uses the latest Modal structure i.e footer, title, etc., See src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\AddCollectionModal.js for how its done. Update The fields in RequestPayoutModal to match whats in CreateWithdrawalRequestInput, withdrawalMethod select should be the first field as it will determine whether some fields should be shown. On submit, call createWithdrawalRequest from WalletStore.

<!-- Pending tasks -->

1. Update src\components\Dashboard\BrandDashboard\BrandDashboard.js, src\components\Dashboard\AdminDashboard\AdminDashboard.js, src\components\General\ProductCard\index.js,
   so that numbers are formatted correctly (i.e thousand, mil, etc), and USD is used instead of Niara or naira sign and amounts, prices, etc are prefixed with USD.
2. 

<!-- To be done -->
