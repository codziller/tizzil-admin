## üìã Pending Features/Fixes

<!-- Pending Tasks start -->

1. Getting the error below when I try to create a product at src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\AddProductModal.js. Please carefully investigate, ask me for additional info if needed, and then fix it. You may have to check the createProductWithInventoryQuery in src\services\products.js

## üîÑ Ongoing Implementation

### Instructions:

1. Add your features/fixes to the "Pending Features/Fixes" section
2. As work begins on an item, it will be moved to "Ongoing Implementation" with üîÑ
3. Once completed, items will be removed completely to keep the plan.md file clean
4. If you're unable to complete a task, add it to an incomplete section with appropriate emoji, so I'd provide further context on it.
5. Feel free to ask for context or clarification for any feature as needed
