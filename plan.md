## ⚠️ Configuration Required

**Google Maps API Not Activated**: The Google Maps JavaScript API needs to be enabled in your Google Cloud Console for the API key `AIzaSyCSsZnlL7NWwOA_qrqaivC0c0I_3GSVH4g`.

To fix this:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
4. Search for "Maps JavaScript API" and enable it
5. Search for "Places API" and enable it
6. Make sure the API key in `.env` (REACT_APP_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY) has access to these APIs

## 🔄 Ongoing Implementation

### Instructions:

1. Add your features/fixes to the "Pending Features/Fixes" section
2. As work begins on an item, it will be moved to "Ongoing Implementation" with 🔄
3. Once completed, items will be removed completely to keep the plan.md file clean
4. If you're unable to complete a task, add it to an incomplete section with appropriate emoji, so I'd provide further context on it.
5. Feel free to ask for context or clarification for any feature as needed
