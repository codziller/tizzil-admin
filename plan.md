# Development Plan

## ⚠️ Errors Encountered

✅ **Fixed**: `selectedProduct is not defined` error in collections.js - Updated reference to use `selectedCollection` instead of `selectedProduct` on line 370.

## 📋 Pending Features/Fixes

<!-- Pending Tasks start -->
1. Update the Tags (comma separated) input in src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\FulfillmentTab.js so that texts can be deleted as currently nothing entered can be deleted, and make each value be able to have space or spaces in between them.
<!-- Pending Tasks end -->

## 🔄 Ongoing Implementation

### Instructions:

1. Add your features/fixes to the "Pending Features/Fixes" section
2. As work begins on an item, it will be moved to "Ongoing Implementation" with 🔄
3. Once completed, items will be removed completely to keep the plan.md file clean
4. If you're unable to complete a task, add it to an incomplete section with appropriate emoji, so I'd provide further context on it.
5. Feel free to ask for context or clarification for any feature as needed
