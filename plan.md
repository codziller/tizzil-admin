<!-- Post new errors here for fixing -->

## üìã Pending Features/Fixes

<!-- Pending Tasks start -->

1. Update src\components\Dashboard\RateCard\RateCard.js so that if cardStyle is 'admin', the icon should be right the right, and the title at the left, the Icon and Title div should be full space between, mb-[30px] shold be reduced to 6px, the Label in rateItems should be hidden, Rate indicator should be 4px below the item.value.
2. Update src\components\Dashboard\AdminDashboard\AdminDashboard.js so that under Main Content Split, You put 3 TopItemsCard 'Top Brands', 'Top Products', 'Top Customers' in a 20px gap grid container(3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tabs, 1 on mobile). Below this container, put a container(20px gap) with Pie Chart Card(2/5 basis), and two TopItemsCard 'Top Affliates' and 'Visitors', on tabs put first 2 cards on a row, third below, and on desktop, put them all on different lines. Below, put Orders table from src\pages\Dashboard\Orders\features\orders.js. Import it directly from there and add props to hide the Title Section of orders in AdminDashboard.

TopItemsCard:
TopItemsCard container should be bg #FFFFFF, br 16px, p 16px, At the top should be a space between row, title(#718096, 16px) by the left, Date Filter by the right. The Date Filter used in src\components\Dashboard\RateCard\RateCard.js should be made into a reusable component, and used in both cards. 12px below the top row, map through the card list passed to it to return a list of the items(px 8px, py-4px, alternating bg of #F9FAFB and white.), each item should be a space between full width row with a row(8px gap) of the icon(if icon - 16px is not passed, use different colors bg circle of 8px size i.e all the items in the list will have the circle in different color) and the item name(12px #111827), and the item value(#718096 12px) by the right.
Note that only the 'Top Brands' TopItemsCard will have icons, use versace, Tom ford, ZTTW, Zanotti, Balenciaga logos(make sure to use the logos). For other TopItemsCards populate with five list items

3. Update src\pages\Dashboard\Brands\features\index.js so that the table is like that in src\pages\Dashboard\Orders\features\orders.js. Pass an array title objects [{title:"Approved Brands", itemCount:approvedBrandsCount}, {title:"Pending Brands", itemCount:pendingBrandsCount} ] and loop through to show Title section in src\components\General\Table\index.js in tab like form. This means if title is passed to the Table, it should show Title section the way it already is, else it should show the Title sections in a tab row, active tab should have the title(#111827), count border and text color (#690007), border-bottom: 2.14px solid #690007, inactive tab should have the title(#999999), count border and text color (#999999), all tabs will have px 20px py 7px.

The table shown should be based on the active tab, in this case, the "Approved Brands" and "Pending Brands" tabs Table will have same Fields 'Brand Logo' (45 px h/w), 'Brand Name', 'No. of orders', 'Revenue', 'Wallet Balance', 'Product Category' (#690007 uppercase), 'AOV', and then the MoreIcon last. On click of a brand, open BrandDetailModal which should be just like src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\ProductDetailsModal.js. Title will be 'Brand Details', at the top will be the banner section where the brand imageUrls[0] is displayed in a 124px height full w banner box with br 16px br. Put an overlay of background: #0000006E; over the image, and in the box, put a row(16px gap) with brand.logoUrl(48px w/h) in the left, and a column(5px gap) with brandName(#FFFFFF bold 16px) and brand email or 'SInce ${yearsInBusiness}'(14px #FFFFFF) below it. 20px below banner section, put row card(bg white, border: 1px solid #DDDDDD, p 20px) the row should be spilt into 3 equal columns with a #E5E7EB 2px w divider. each column(8px gap) should have title(14px #777777), and value(16px #111111 bold) all aligned center with text align left, the titles are 'Total orders', 'Total Revenue', 'Wallet Balance'. 24 px below, put 'Details'(#111827 17px bold) and 20px below, put the details rows. each detail row(py 8px, border-bottom: 1px solid #BBBBBB80, space between) will have label(16px #4B5563) by the left and value(16px #444444) by the right. The labels are 'Product Category', 'Address', 'Country/City', 'Brand Bio'( brand bio should be a 18px gap column, label at the top, value below).
20px below put Socials(16px #4B5563), and 18px below it, put a column(4px gap column) with details rows. The addition to the detail row here is that there'd be an icon 8px to the left of the label. The labels will be 'Instagram', 'Tiktok', 'Website', 'Shopify Store Url'(shopifyStoreUrl). make sure the value in details row does not overflow but insteads breaks to the next line with text align right and put a gap of 6px in the row for good measure. If the brand is a pending(from status(UNDER_REVIEW) of the brand which can be APPROVED
REJECTED
UNDER_REVIEW) brand, show in the modal footer (mt 24px), 'Have you reviewed this brand? If yes you can proceed to approve or otherwise.'(#000000 16px), and 20px below, put 'APPROVE' primary button and 'REJECT' isOutline button.

4. inside src\pages\Dashboard\Users\features, add the file for Discover users. use src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\categories.js to model it. Replace of ProductCard, with UserCard which is just like ProductCard with the exceptions that the card container and image at the top have no br, the name is not bold, and the product images circles should be 6px to the left of the name and should just be one instead of a loop of 4. The the description will be kept too, and 16px below the description, put the action section inside a px-16px py-6px container. The action section(bg #F6F7F1 px-12px py-8px) is s row split into two parts by a 1px #D9D9D9 divider, either parts of the action section should be 6px gap row with icon and text, first src\assets\icons\approve-icon.svg and 'Approve'(13px #111111), second src\assets\icons\reject-icon.svg 'Reject'(13px #690007). Open approve or reject modal based on the button clicked. which is a modal asking them to confirm the action.
   Make sure that you make UserCard a component in its own file and import as necessary. Also, make ProductCard in src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\categories.js a component in its own file and import to be used in src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\categories.js, src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\collections.js, and src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\index.js

5. Inside src\pages\Dashboard\Users\features, put AdminUsers.js. User src\pages\Dashboard\Users\features\index.js as guide for the AdminUsers page. In the Title Section, replace the Export Section with Add User Button (arranged just like Add Collection Button in src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\collections.js). On click of the Add User Button, open AddUserModal which should be just like src\pages\Dashboard\Products\features\AddCollectionModal.js with the title 'Add New User', and fields 'Enter first name', 'Enter first name'(both in a 20px gap row), 'Enter email', 'Enter password', and 'Select permission' (multi selction) the permision options should be all the labels in adminNavItems in src\components\Layout\Components\SideNav\ModernSideNav.js. Update components/General/Input/Select so that if isMulti, the selected options are arranged below the select input just like in src\pages\Dashboard\Settings\features\DeliverySettings.js, so that there's no need to do the mapping everywhere isMulti select is used, also, hide the selected options showing inside the actual select input for isMulti as they are currently look distorted and overflow out of the confines of the select, so the options showing below is better. When a User is clicked, open the UserDetailsModal(put all modals in a differnt file and import as needed). For the UserDetailsModal, the title is 'USER PERMISIONS', and at the top, put a row with user icon(24px while) in a 46px br 8px box, and a column(4px gap) 16px to its right. The column should have the user firstName and lastName(14px #111827) at the top, and user email(#6D7280 12px) below. 24px below the row, put "Details"(16px. #4B5563), and 20px below it put a column(border: 1px solid #DDDDDD, bg white, br 4px, p 16px, gap 8px). Inside the column, put a list of permission items (the adminNavItems from ModernSideNav). Each permission item will be a row(full width, border-bottom: 0.8px solid #D2D2D2, pb 8px, space between), by the left, put a 13px gap row with the icon(icon from adminNavItems) in a box(37px w/h, br 3px, bg #6900071A;, text color #690007, and also add a className of sidenav-active ), a column(2px gap) right of the box with the permission name(label from adminNavItems, 16px, #111827) at the top, and permision label(12px #111827) at the bottom of the column. At the right end of the permission item, put Toggle from components/General/Toggle to toggle on or off a permission.

## üîÑ Ongoing Implementation

## üîß Fixed Errors

### Critical Dashboard Component Errors - üéâ Permanently Fixed!

**Summary:** Fixed all destructuring errors in dashboard components caused by null localStorage data

**Errors Fixed:**

1. ‚úÖ **HeaderDropDown Component Error** - Fixed destructuring of null getUserInfoFromStorage() result
2. ‚úÖ **SideNav Component Error** - Fixed destructuring of null user data
3. ‚úÖ **ListOfProviders Component Error** - Fixed potential similar destructuring issue
4. ‚úÖ **Storage Utility Enhancement** - Added proper null checking and error handling

**Root Cause:** Components were trying to destructure `{ user }` directly from `getUserInfoFromStorage()` when the function returned null.

**Permanent Fix Applied:**

- **HeaderDropDown.js**: Changed `const { user } = getUserInfoFromStorage()` to safe destructuring pattern
- **SideNav/index.js**: Applied same fix to prevent null destructuring
- **ListOfProviders.js**: Proactively fixed potential issue
- **storage.js**: Enhanced `getUserInfoFromStorage()` with proper null handling and error logging

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Before (Causing Errors)
const { user } = getUserInfoFromStorage(); // Crashes if null

// After (Safe Pattern)
const userData = getUserInfoFromStorage();
const user = userData?.user; // Safe even if userData is null
```

**Result:**

- All dashboard components now load without errors
- HeaderDropDown displays correctly with user information
- SideNav renders properly with navigation items
- No more React error boundaries triggered
- Robust error handling for missing localStorage data
- Future-proof against similar destructuring issues

## ‚úÖ Completed Features/Fixes

### Enhanced Table Header and Cell Alignment Fix - üéâ Fixed!

**Summary:** Fixed misalignment issues between table headers and their respective cells in enhanced tables across Orders, Reviews, Users, and Wallet pages

**Issue Identified:**

The enhanced tables in multiple dashboard pages had misaligned headers and cells where:

- Headers and cells didn't have the same exact width
- Starting positions were inconsistent between header and data rows
- Checkbox containers, cell content, and context menu areas had different spacing
- Flex classes were being overridden by default `flex-1` in cells

**Technical Implementation:**

**Table Header Component (`TableHeader`) Updates:**

- **Checkbox Container**: Added consistent width `w-[30px]` to checkbox container
- **Context Menu Spacer**: Added spacer `<div className="w-5 ml-2"></div>` to maintain alignment with rows that have context menus
- **Consistent Structure**: Ensured exact same padding and spacing as table rows

**Table Row Component (`TableRow`) Updates:**

- **Checkbox Container**: Matched header with `w-[30px]` width for checkbox container
- **Cell Class Override**: Changed from `clsx("flex-1", cell.className)` to `clsx(cell.className)` to prevent overriding specific flex values
- **Conditional Context Menu**: Either shows context menu button or spacer div with same dimensions
- **Consistent Structure**: Mirrored header layout exactly

**Key Changes:**

```javascript
// Header Row - Fixed Structure
<div className="flex items-center px-4 py-2">
  {hasCheckbox && (
    <div className="flex items-center mr-4 w-[30px]">
      <input type="checkbox" ... />
    </div>
  )}
  {heads.map((head, index) => (
    <div className={clsx("...", head.className)}>
      {head.name}
    </div>
  ))}
  <div className="w-5 ml-2"></div> {/* Spacer for alignment */}
</div>

// Table Row - Matching Structure
<div className="flex items-center px-4 py-3 ...">
  {hasCheckbox && (
    <div className="flex items-center mr-4 w-[30px]">
      <input type="checkbox" ... />
    </div>
  )}
  {cells.map((cell, index) => (
    <div className={clsx(cell.className)}> {/* Removed flex-1 override */}
      {cell.content}
    </div>
  ))}
  {contextMenuOptions.length > 0 ? (
    <button className="w-5 ml-2">...</button>
  ) : (
    <div className="w-5 ml-2"></div>
  )}
</div>
```

- Maintains existing icon color changing functionality (already working correctly)

**Code Implementation:**

```javascript
// Mobile Navigation in ModernDashboardLayout
{
  /* Desktop Sidebar */
}
<div className="hidden lg:block">
  <ModernSideNav isCollapsed={sidenavCollapsed} toggleSidenav={toggleSidenav} />
</div>;

{
  /* Mobile Sidebar with Backdrop */
}
<div className="lg:hidden">
  <ModernSideNav
    withBackDrop
    sidenavOpen={sidenavOpen}
    setSidenavOpen={setSidenavOpen}
  />
</div>;

{
  /* Mobile Hamburger */
}
<Hamburger
  click={() => setSidenavOpen(!sidenavOpen)}
  className={sidenavOpen ? "ham_crossed" : ""}
/>;

// Enhanced Active State Logic in ModernSideNav
const isMainItemActive = (item) => {
  if (item.subItems && item.subItems.length > 0) {
    const isSubItemActive = item.subItems.some((subItem) =>
      isActive(subItem.path)
    );
    if (isSubItemActive) {
      return false; // Don't show active on main item if sub item is active
    }
  }
  return isActive(item.path);
};

### SignUpOtp Countdown Timing Fix - üéâ Fixed!

**Summary:** Fixed SignUpOtp countdown timer to start only when user navigates to the OTP page, not while they're still filling out the signup form

**Issue Identified:**

- Countdown timer started immediately when SignUpOtp component mounted
- Due to the horizontal scroll container design, both Signup and SignUpOtp components were rendered simultaneously
- User could still be filling out the signup form while the countdown was already running
- This caused the countdown to expire before users even reached the OTP verification step

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Enhanced `src/pages/OnBoarding/SignUp/features/index.js`:**

  - Added `isActive={currentStep === 1}` prop to SignUpOtp component
  - Passes the active state based on current step in the signup flow

- **Enhanced `src/pages/OnBoarding/SignUp/features/SignUpOtp.js`:**
  - Changed countdown initialization from `useState(59)` to `useState(null)`
  - Added `isActive` prop to component interface
  - Implemented activation-based countdown start using useEffect
  - Updated countdown logic to handle null state properly
  - Enhanced formatTime function to display "--:--" when countdown hasn't started
  - Added PropTypes validation for new isActive prop

**Root Cause:**
The signup flow uses a horizontal scroll container that renders both components simultaneously for smooth transitions. This meant:

1. User loads signup page ‚Üí Both Signup and SignUpOtp components mount immediately
2. SignUpOtp starts countdown from 59 seconds ‚Üí Timer begins while user is still in signup form
3. User fills out form ‚Üí Countdown continues running in background
4. User navigates to OTP ‚Üí Countdown may have already expired or has limited time left

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Conditional Activation**: Countdown only starts when `isActive` prop is true
2. **State Management**: Initialize countdown as null, set to 59 only when component becomes active
3. **Enhanced Display**: Show "--:--" when countdown hasn't started yet
4. **Proper Timing**: Timer begins exactly when user navigates to OTP verification step
5. **Clean Implementation**: Maintains existing functionality while fixing timing issue

**Code Implementation:**

```javascript
// Initialize countdown as null instead of 59
const [countdown, setCountdown] = useState(null);

// Start countdown only when component becomes active
useEffect(() => {
  if (isActive && countdown === null) {
    console.log("SignUpOtp component is now active, starting countdown");
    setCountdown(59);
    setCanResend(false);
  }
}, [isActive, countdown]);

// Handle null state in countdown logic
useEffect(() => {
  let timer = null;
  if (countdown !== null && countdown > 0) {
    timer = setTimeout(() => setCountdown(countdown - 1), 1000);
  } else if (countdown === 0) {
    setCanResend(true);
  }
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [countdown]);

// Display appropriate time format
const formatTime = (seconds) => {
  if (seconds === null) return "--:--";
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const remainingSeconds = seconds % 60;
  return `${minutes}:${remainingSeconds.toString().padStart(2, "0")}`;
};
```

**Result:**

- ‚úÖ Fixed countdown timing to start only when user reaches OTP verification page
- ‚úÖ Eliminated premature countdown expiration during signup form filling
- ‚úÖ Maintained smooth horizontal scroll transition between steps
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience with proper timing expectations
- ‚úÖ Added clear visual indication when countdown hasn't started ("--:--")
- ‚úÖ Enhanced debugging capabilities with console logs
- ‚úÖ Preserved all existing functionality while fixing core timing issue

### SignUpOtp LocalStorage Data Access Fix - üéâ Fixed!

**Summary:** Fixed SignUpOtp component where Continue button showed "Failing to submit: 9087 null" error due to localStorage data not being accessible quickly enough

**Issue Identified:**

- SignUpOtp component was logging "Failing to submit: 9087 null" when user entered OTP and clicked Continue button
- The OTP value (9087) was correctly captured, but `signupData` was null
- Root cause was a timing issue where localStorage data wasn't available immediately when component mounted
- Race condition between component rendering and localStorage data retrieval

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Enhanced `src/pages/OnBoarding/SignUp/features/SignUpOtp.js`:**

  - Added comprehensive debugging logs to track data flow
  - Implemented retry mechanism for localStorage data loading
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed condition checking
  - Added fallback data reload mechanism in handleSubmit function
  - Improved error messages for better troubleshooting

- **Enhanced `src/pages/OnBoarding/SignUp/features/Signup.js`:**
  - Added debugging logs to verify data storage process
  - Added verification step to confirm localStorage data was stored successfully
  - Enhanced error handling in signup submission flow

**Root Cause:**
The SignUpOtp component was trying to access localStorage data immediately on mount, but due to browser timing or navigation delays, the data wasn't always available. This caused:

1. User completes signup form ‚Üí Data stored in localStorage
2. Navigation to OTP page ‚Üí Component mounts immediately
3. useEffect tries to read localStorage ‚Üí Data not yet accessible
4. signupData remains null ‚Üí Submission fails with "9087 null" error

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Added retry logic that attempts to reload data after 100ms if initial load fails
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Individual condition checking for OTP length vs signupData availability
3. **Fallback Recovery**: handleSubmit now attempts to reload data from localStorage if signupData is null
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logs to track data flow and identify issues
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages guide user if data cannot be recovered

**Code Implementation:**

```javascript
// Retry mechanism in useEffect
if (!loadSignupData()) {
  const retryTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Retrying to load signup data...");
    loadSignupData();
  }, 100);
  return () => clearTimeout(retryTimer);
}

// Fallback recovery in handleSubmit
if (!signupData) {
  const storedData = localStorage.getItem("signupFormData");
  if (storedData) {
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(storedData);
    setSignupData(parsedData);
    console.log("Successfully reloaded signup data, please try again");
    return;
  }
}
```

**Result:**

- ‚úÖ Fixed "Failing to submit: 9087 null" console error
- ‚úÖ OTP submission now works reliably even with localStorage timing issues
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging and error recovery mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience with clear error handling
- ‚úÖ Maintained all existing functionality while adding robustness

### SignUpOtp Continue Button Fix - üéâ Fixed!

**Summary:** Fixed SignUpOtp component where Continue button wasn't working properly when OTP was entered

**Issue Identified:**

- OTPInput component had its own internal state that wasn't properly syncing with the parent component's value prop
- The component was ignoring the `value` prop passed from SignUpOtp and managing its own state independently
- This caused a disconnect between what the user typed and what the parent component received

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Updated `src/components/General/Input/OTPInput.js`:**

  - Added `useEffect` to properly sync internal state with the `value` prop from parent
  - When `value` prop changes, the internal state updates accordingly
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
  - Fixed state synchronization between parent and child components

- **Enhanced `src/pages/OnBoarding/SignUp/features/SignUpOtp.js`:**
  - Added proper error handling in `handleSubmit` function
  - Wrapped signup call in try-catch for better error management
  - Maintained existing functionality while improving reliability

**Root Cause:**
The OTPInput component was using `useState(new Array(numInputs).fill(''))` for its internal state but never updating it when the `value` prop changed. This meant:

1. User types OTP ‚Üí OTPInput internal state updates ‚Üí `onChange` called with OTP string
2. Parent component receives OTP and updates its state
3. Parent re-renders with new `value` prop, but OTPInput ignores it
4. State becomes out of sync, causing submission issues

**Solution:**
Added `useEffect` to monitor `value` prop changes and sync the internal state:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (value) {
    const otpArray = value.split("").slice(0, numInputs);
    while (otpArray.length < numInputs) {
      otpArray.push("");
    }
    setOtp(otpArray);
  } else {
    setOtp(new Array(numInputs).fill(""));
  }
}, [value, numInputs]);
```

**Result:**

- ‚úÖ Continue button now works immediately when 4-digit OTP is entered
- ‚úÖ Proper state synchronization between OTPInput and parent components
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and debugging capabilities
- ‚úÖ Maintained all existing functionality and styling
- ‚úÖ Fixed the core issue without breaking changes
