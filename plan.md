## ⚠️ Errors Encountered

## 📋 Pending Features/Fixes

<!-- Pending Tasks start -->

## 🔄 Ongoing Implementation

### Instructions:

1. Add your features/fixes to the "Pending Features/Fixes" section
2. As work begins on an item, it will be moved to "Ongoing Implementation" with 🔄
3. Once completed, items will be removed completely to keep the plan.md file clean
4. If you're unable to complete a task, add it to an incomplete section with appropriate emoji, so I'd provide further context on it.
5. Feel free to ask for context or clarification for any feature as needed
